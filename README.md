# Modified Chess Game

This project is a custom-built chess game implemented in Python using the Tkinter GUI library. The primary rule modification enhances the traditional Bishop piece to move like a Queen, allowing for both diagonal and straight-line movement. The game features a user-friendly interface, move history tracking, and an AI opponent playing as Black.

## Features

- Modified Bishop movement (diagonal + horizontal + vertical)
- AI opponent with simple evaluation-based move selection
- Graphical user interface using Tkinter
- Move history display using algebraic notation
- Check and checkmate detection
- New Game and Quit functionality
- Legal move highlighting

## Modified Rule

> **Bishop Movement**: In this version of chess, Bishops move like Queens â€” both diagonally and in straight lines. This adds complexity and new strategic opportunities to the gameplay.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter** (Standard GUI library for Python)
